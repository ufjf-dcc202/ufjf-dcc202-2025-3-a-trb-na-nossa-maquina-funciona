# LoopBot Game 
- This repository documents part of the development process of the game LoopBot, inspired by LightBot, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It corresponds to the version submitted to the professor for the Web Development course at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora.

## How the Game Works
- The player controls a robot on a 5x5 grid by assembling a sequence of commands that are executed step by step after all commands have been set.
- The objective of each level is to navigate the robot across different terrain heights and activate all light tiles. The current game includes three levels with increasing difficulty and supports procedural logic using MAIN, P1, and P2 command sections.

- This project significantly improved my algorithmic thinking and ability to design logic-driven systems.

## Technologies That We Used and Improved
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox)
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- Bootstrap Icons 
- DOM manipulation 
- Event listeners
- Objects for state management
- Arrays for command storage
- Loops (for, forEach)
- Conditional logic
- Execution with setTimeout
- Dynamic UI updates
- Game state control
- Boundary checking
- Height comparison logic
- Modular function design
- Game Logic Features
- 5x5 dynamically generated board
- Multi-level system
- Terrain height system (low, medium, high)
- Jump validation logic
- Death handling and animation
- Win condition validation (all lights activated)
- Overlay system for game results
- Button state control (enable/disable during execution)
- Procedural execution with nested commands (P1 and P2)

## Conclusion
Through this project, We improved my understanding of:
- HTML semantics and syntax
- CSS layout techniques, including Flexbox and Grid
- CSS selectors and specificity
- Smooth movement effects using CSS transitions
- DOM manipulation in JavaScript
- Logical thinking and control flow in JavaScript
